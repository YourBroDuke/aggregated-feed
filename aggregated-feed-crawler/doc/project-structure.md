### Folder & File Breakdown

- **package.json**: Project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.
- **.env**: Environment variables (should be in `.gitignore`).
- **config/**: Configuration files for different environments.
- **src/**: Main application logic.
  - **routes/**: Route definitions and handlers, grouped by resource or feature.
  - **plugins/**: Custom Fastify plugins for modular functionality.
  - **services/**: Business logic and data access layers.
  - **models/**: Data models (e.g., Mongoose, Prisma, or custom classes).
  - **index.js**: Main Fastify server setup and bootstrapping.
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests, ideally mirroring the `src/` structure for clarity and maintainability.

## Best Practices

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep routes, plugins, services, and models in distinct folders for clarity and modularity.
- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, consistent naming conventions (e.g., kebab-case for files, PascalCase for classes).
- **Configuration Management**: Isolate config files and use environment variables for sensitive or environment-specific data.
- **Testing**: Place tests in a dedicated `tests/` directory, mirroring the structure of your source code for easier navigation and maintenance.
- **Use Index Files**: Consider using `index.js` files in directories to aggregate exports, simplifying imports elsewhere in your codebase.

This modular approach keeps business logic out of route handlers and promotes testability and reusability.

| Folder/File   | Purpose                                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| src/crawlers  | Crawler implementations for each platform    |
| src/jobs      | Cron jobs for syncing up feed&user profile   |
| src/models    | Data models (ORM/ODM)                        |
| src/plugins   | Custom Fastify plugins                       |
| src/routes    | API route handlers                           |
| src/services  | Business logic and data access               |
| src/utils     | Utilities                                    |
| tests/        | Unit and integration tests                   |
| .env          | Environment variables                        |
| package.json  | Project metadata and dependencies            |

This structure is a strong starting point for most Fastify applications.
